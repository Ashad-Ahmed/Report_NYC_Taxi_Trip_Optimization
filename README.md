# 🚖 NYC Taxi Trip Optimization - EDA

This project is part of my coursework at **IIIT Bangalore**, focusing on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of New York City taxi trips. The objective was to derive meaningful insights from raw trip data and explore how various factors affect taxi ride dynamics across the city.

## 🔍 Project Overview

The dataset contains detailed records of taxi rides in NYC, including pickup/drop-off locations, timestamps, fare amounts, passenger count, and more. Through this project, I aimed to:

- Understand temporal trends in taxi usage
- Identify high-traffic zones and peak hours
- Examine how fare varies with distance and passenger count
- Visualize travel patterns using geospatial plots

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- **Python**
- **Pandas** & **NumPy** – for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** – for visualizations
- **GeoPandas** – for geospatial mapping

## 📈 Key Insights

- Peak taxi activity occurs during weekday rush hours and weekend evenings
- Midtown Manhattan stands out as a major pickup and drop-off hub
- Longer trips don’t always mean higher fares – several factors influence pricing
- Visualizations reveal strong geographic and temporal patterns in city-wide mobility
